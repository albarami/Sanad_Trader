      "Do not compute or report Sharpe ratio until at least 30 independent returns exist; current estimate would be statistically meaningless.",
      "Pause live deployment until sufficient trade frequency is achieved; zero trades in 7/30/90-day windows indicates system inactivity or filtering too strict.",
