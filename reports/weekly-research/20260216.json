  "research": "### Weekly Macro Crypto Analysis (Week of Feb 9-16, 2026)\n\n**1. BTC/ETH Price Action and Key Levels**  \nBTC consolidated between $65,000-$70,000 amid a 47.5% YTD drawdown, reflecting orderly deleveraging with 90-day realized volatility at 38 (half of 2022 bear levels); approaching 50% peak-to-trough decline, downside risk absorbed absent new catalysts[5][7].  \nETH traded in $1,900-$2,735 range, down ~40% since mid-January, stuck near $1,970-$2,000 with support at $1,902 and resistance at $2,051 (23.6% Fib); Elliott Wave targets 1,772 low, below 20/50/100/200-day MAs (3,068-3,670)[1][2][3][4][8].  \n**Actionable:** BTC short below 65k targeting 60,622; ETH short below 2,051 to 1,772/1,850.\n\n**2. Major Regulatory Developments**  \nNo major updates this week; prior Fed policy uncertainty and $8.9bn BTC/ETH options expiry (Jan 30) lingered into Feb volatility[1].\n\n**3. Notable DeFi/Meme Coin Trends**  \nDeFi expansion cited in long-term ETH forecasts (Standard Chartered $4k EOY 2026 via stablecoins/institutional adoption), but short-term weak with ETH mirroring bear market and holder exodus[3][4].  \nMeme coins not highlighted; sector down with broader alts (SOL -69.5% YTD)[5].\n\n**4. Upcoming Catalysts**  \n- FOMC: Ongoing policy outlook uncertainty driving swings[1].  \n- ETF decisions/unlocks/launches: None specified; monitor CME gaps for ETH ($2,110 trend confirmation)[6].  \n**Actionable:** Position for post-FOMC volatility; avoid entries pre-event.\n\n**5. On-Chain Metrics Summary**  \nETH SOPR signals loss saturation near $2,000, but new address growth falling and weak inflows cap recovery; whale activity and CME gap risk key at $2,110/$1,850[4][6].  \nBTC/ETH exchange flows elevated from Feb selloff deleveraging; no fresh whale data[5]. Stablecoin supply supportive long-term per forecasts[3].\n\n**6. Risk Factors for Coming Week**  \nBearish ETH wave Z to 1,772; BTC sub-wave 5 to 60,622; persistent $2,051 ETH rejection risks retest of $1,902[2][4].  \nMacro: Crypto winter rumors, 20%+ YTD BTC drop without capitulation[3][5][7].  \n**Actionable:** Tight stops above 2,051 (ETH)/65k (BTC); hedge with shorts.\n\n**7. Meme Coin Sector Narratives**  \nNo specific momentum shifts; broader alt/meme weakness tied to ETH/BTC drawdowns (-60.7% ETH, -69.5% SOL YTD), with stabilization attempts failing[5][7].  \n**Actionable:** Fade meme pumps below ETH $2,000 support.",
